I've finally moved my blog from Blogspot to Github pages. The blog is now powered by [Octopress] [1]. Blogspot was convient but for a developer there are several reasons to switch. Octopress generates a static website that can be deployed anywhere so you gain independence from a service provider. Your posts are Markdown files that can be authored in your favorite editor. The blog source is under version control. Another great feature: code syntax highlighting works out of the box.
